This repository contains the code required to reproduce the figures, tables, and supplementary visualizations associated with the manuscript submitted by Mlambo et al. (2026).

## Raw data

All the data used in these analyses are available from online repositories and can be downloaded for individual countries. 
- Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) can be obtained upon registration at <a href=https://dhsprogram.com/data/>
- Relative wealth index (RWI) data from Chi et al.’s model are available at <a href=https://data.humdata.org/dataset/relative-wealth-index>
- International wealth index (IWI) poverty maps by Lee and Braithwaite are publicly accessible at  <a href=https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5OGWYM>
- Yeh et al.’s wealth index data can be found at  <a href=https://github.com/sustainlab-group/africa_poverty>

## Instructions
To set up your environment variables, you need to duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this manually or using the following terminal command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # Linux, macOS, Git Bash, WSL
copy .env.example .env # Windows Command Prompt
```

This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names it `.env`, allowing you to configure your environment variables specific to your setup.
